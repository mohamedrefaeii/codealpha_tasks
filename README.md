# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Decision Tree

Welcome to the **Iris Flower Classification Project**!
This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning task that uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. It includes **data loading, visualization, model training, evaluation**, and result visualization using Python and popular data science libraries.

## 📖 Overview

This project performs multi-class classification on the **Iris dataset**, which is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify an iris flower into one of the following species:

* **Setosa**
* **Versicolor**
* **Virginica**

The classification is based on four features:

* Sepal length (cm)
* Sepal width (cm)
* Petal length (cm)
* Petal width (cm)

---

## 📊 Dataset

* 📂 **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository (via GitHub)](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/blob/gh-pages/data/iris.csv)
* 🧪 **Samples**: 150 rows (50 for each species)
* 📈 **Features**: 4 numeric columns + 1 categorical target

The dataset is balanced and clean, which makes it perfect for classification experiments.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Or manually install:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 3. Run the script:

```bash
python iris_decision_tree.py
```

The script will:

* Load the dataset
* Visualize the class distribution
* Train a Decision Tree model
* Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification report
* Show a confusion matrix heatmap

---

## ✅ Results

* The Decision Tree achieved **high accuracy (\~100%)** on the test set.
* All three classes were well separated.
* The confusion matrix shows that the model did not misclassify any samples (may vary slightly due to data split).

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Here are some ideas to make the project even better:

* Try other models: `RandomForest`, `KNN`, `SVM`, `LogisticRegression`
* Add cross-validation for more reliable metrics
* Build a **web app** using **Streamlit** to allow user interaction
* Export the model using `joblib` or `pickle` for deployment
* Apply hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
